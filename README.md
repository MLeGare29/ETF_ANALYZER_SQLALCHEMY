# PASSIVE INVESTING: ETF ANALYZER

To display the rise of passive investing, this comprehensive Jupyter Lab Notebook builds a financial database and web application that not only analyzes a single dataframe table using the powerful SQL language, facilitated by Python's SQL toolkit, but also joins data from multiple table into one dataframe - in which the annualized and cumulative returns for the composite data will be calculated and plotted. Lastly, this Notebook employs the capabilities of the Voil√† library to view this analysis on as a web application. The elements covered in this Notebook are as follows:  

   1. Analyze a single asset in the ETF

   2. Optimize data access with advanced SQL queries

   3. Analyze the ETF portfolio

   4. Deploy the notebook as a web application


## TECHNOLOGIES

In order for this immersive code and application to run, there are installation requirements. They are the following:

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Enables the user to use the powerful Python programming language.

[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) - Access to the web-based IDE JupyterLab.  

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Grants access to the open-source Pandas data analysis tool, which is powered by Python.

[HVPLOT](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) - Enables the user to implement and use the interactive hvplot system to view and map data values.

[SQLALCHEMY](https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy/) - Grants access to the Python SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

[VOILA](https://voila-gallery.org/) - Allows developers to deploy their Jupyter Lab Notebooks as a web application.
