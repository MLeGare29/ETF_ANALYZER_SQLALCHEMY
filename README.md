# PASSIVE INVESTING: ETF ANALYZER

To display the rise of passive investing, this comprehensive Jupyter Lab Notebook builds a financial database and web application that not only analyzes a single dataframe table using the powerful SQL language, facilitated by Python's SQL toolkit, but also joins data from multiple table into one dataframe - in which the annualized and cumulative returns for the composite data will be calculated and plotted. Lastly, this Notebook employs the capabilities of the Voil√† library to view this analysis on as a web application. The elements covered in this Notebook are as follows:  

   1. Analyze a single asset in the ETF

   2. Optimize data access with advanced SQL queries

   3. Analyze the ETF portfolio

   4. Deploy the notebook as a web application
